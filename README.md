Abe Gjura Module 1 Challenge
# Kickstarting with Excel
[Abe Gjura] The module taught us to use excel and some advance features to work with a large data set.  
In this project we reused the data from the Class Module to prove we are able to use the features and 
formulas reviewed during class and in Module 1 and apply I to a real-world Scenario. Formulas such as 
VLOOKUP,COUNTIFS truly tested are ability on how to parse through large amounts of data.

## Overview of Project
[Abe Gjura] To help Louise have a better visualization of her donation data by sorting the “plays” subcategory into
 “successful, “failed” or “canceled” and to identify the number in each category at a very specific donation range.

### Purpose
[Abe Gjura] The project tested are skill sin creating a pivot table, how to search for data, or determining data 
value using formulas such as SUM and COUNTIFS, as well as creating different types of charts to graphically 
represent the results.

## Analysis and Challenges
[Abe Gjura] The overall exercise was straightforward and only tested apportion of the skills we learned in module 1.
Though they were the most complex and needed to be used in a real-world assignment. The challenge with COUNTIFS 
proved to be the most laborious as editing he formula for each field.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
[Abe Gjura] In this exercise we were asked to provide a visualization to display the outcomes based by Launch date (month): 
“successful”, “failed”, and “canceled” for the “theater” subcategory. Once the pivot was sorted to display this by 
month, we were asked to create a line chart. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
[Abe Gjura] In this exercise we were asked to provide a visualization of the number of outcomes: “successful”, “failed”, and 
“canceled” for the “plays” subcategory at different investment levels. We created a table displaying the Investment
levels and then providing the count at each level for “successful”, “failed”, and “canceled” for the “play”
subcategory. The chart shows the “plays” category had a successful year of fund raising except for donations between
45000 to 49999.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
[Abe Gjura] The most difficult part of the challenge was the COUNTIFS as I needed to watch the video a few times to get it right.
Also, can we submit our written analysis in .txt or .doc format. I also found I difficult to add a legend to chart and
Asked the Class in Slack. VLOOKUPS were challenging but were not in the challenge; which I found surprising.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
[Abe Gjura] Theater fundrasisng was mostly successful for most of the year as the chart shows the "successful" line 
outperforming the "failed" or "canceled".  The “theater” subcategory was successful for most of the year and only
in December did the number of “successful” pledges and “failed” pledges converge.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
[Abe Gjura] The fundrasing for the "plays" sub-categroy was quite successful with most of the donation levels. 
The community supporting "plays" seem to follow through with their donation pledges and do not cancel of fail to 
come through with their pledges.


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Each of the line itesm in the excel does not list out actual donations so we coudnt provide a min or max for apsecifi play or song. Also, 


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could put together Box and Whisker Charts to show quartiles. We could created a pic chart for each of the outcomes to show the % each cateogory or sub-category.
